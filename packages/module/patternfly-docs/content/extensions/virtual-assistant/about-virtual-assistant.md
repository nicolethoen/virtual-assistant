**Note:** The PatternFly chatbot extension lives in its own package [`@patternfly/virtual-assistant`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@patternfly/virtual-assistant)

It is important to leverage AI in a way that improves the experiences of your users. In alignment with our [AI principles](/patternfly-ai/about-ai#ai-principles) and [ethical design guidelines,](/patternfly-ai/ai-guidelines) we've created this chatbot extension. The PatternFly chatbot contains a React implementation of an AI chatbot, to provide your users with access to convenient and persistent help.

*Only use this chatbot when it adds value to your users' experiences.* Don't use it simply for the sake of novelty&mdash;your users will only be excited to interact with a new chatbot feature if it directly helps them reach their goals.

## How to use the chatbot

To illustrate the capabilities of the chatbot, we offer a [chatbot container demo](/patternfly-ai/chatbot/overview/demo) and a [chatbot attachments demo](/patternfly-ai/chatbot/messages/demo). To learn how to write for chatbot experiences, refer to our [chatbot writing guidelines.](/patternfly-ai/conversation-design/#writing-for-chatbots)

We currently support the follow features to customize your chatbot experience: 
- [The chatbot container](/patternfly-ai/chatbot/ui#container)
- [A toggle for the chatbot container](/patternfly-ai/chatbot/ui#toggle)
- [The chatbot header](/patternfly-ai/chatbot/ui#header)
- [The chatbot footer](/patternfly-ai/chatbot/ui#footer)
- [Messages, from the chatbot and from users](/patternfly-ai/chatbot/messages)
- [Chatbot attachments](/patternfly-ai/chatbot/messages#attachments)
- [Conversation history](/patternfly-ai/chatbot/ui#navigation)

We will continue to grow and evolve our chatbot. If you notice a bug or have any suggestions, feel free to file an issue in our [GitHub repository!](https://github.com/patternfly/virtual-assistant/issues) Make sure to check if there is already a pre-existing issue before creating a new one.
